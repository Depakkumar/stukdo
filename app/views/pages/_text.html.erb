<p>Dependencies
Some plugins and CSS components depend on other plugins. If you include plugins individually, make sure to check for these dependencies in the docs. Also note that all plugins depend on jQuery (this means jQuery must be included before the plugin files). Consult our package.json to see which versions of jQuery are supported.

Our dropdowns, popovers and tooltips also depend on Popper.js.</p>
